//! Integration test verifying that the gateway's channel registry remains
//! consistent across a network partition.
//!
//! After a full partition is imposed and then lifted, a reconnecting viewer
//! should receive a fresh `ServerInfo` and advertisements for all channels —
//! including those created while the network was down.
//!
//! These tests require the netem Docker Compose overlay:
//!   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.netem.yml up -d --wait
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test -p remote_access_tests -- --ignored netem_partition_`
